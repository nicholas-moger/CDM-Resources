This plugin is very much EXPERIMENTAL - it will be formally released once development is complete, but for now it is perfect to get intellisense/linting/copilot integration working but there are some language semantics and performance issues.

Note you do not NEED this plugin to do any builds - this is purely so Rune DSL can be recognised as a language within vscode.
